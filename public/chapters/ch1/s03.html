                There are thousands and thousands of documented cases of
                bizarre, inexplicable and extraordinary things happening to
                ordinary people.
              </p>

              <p>
                There are many, many people who have had recent brushes with the
                paranormal. There are people who became spontaneously invisible.
                People who have disappeared out of moving vehicles only to
                appear a few seconds later confused and disoriented... and
                hundreds of miles away from where they were. People who wake up
                to discover they were literally sleeping on air, and then come
                crashing down as soon as they realize what they are doing
                is "impossible."
              </p>

              <p>The list goes on and on.</p>

              <p>
                We've all heard the myths and legends of these sorts of things
                at some point in our lives, and for every story of a spontaneous
                occurrence that manages to stumble its way into a tabloid
                newspaper there are thousands of even more amazing things that
                are being done deliberately, carefully and quietly by an elite
                group of people who can do them repeatedly and at will.
              </p>

              <p>
                These incredible happenings and many, many more are documented
                throughout human history.
              </p>

              <p>
                The truth is, there are people out there doing miraculous things
                right now, and the people doing them are the “Whole-ly” ones.
              </p>

              <p>
                These "whole" people have learned to recognize that humans are
                more than just the flesh that people wear. people are exquisite,
                subtle creatures of both matter and energy, and once people
                remember how to manipulate and control that energy part of
                ourselves, extraordinary things become possible.
              </p>

              <p>
                “Holy” people have learned to see the world in a different way,
                and this new perspective lets them understand how the reality
                that people perceive really works.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once a person understand how things work, a person will
                understand where and how to focus their efforts to create
                real, tangible, "miraculous" changes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Most of these miraculous people have one thing in common... at
                one time or another they all started out pretty much just like us, until something or someone led them to start
                thinking outside the box.
              </p>

              <p>
                Some had help like a teacher, Guru or in our case, a book. Some
                had no help.
              </p>

              <p>
                Some of them are deeply spiritual. Some of them are not. Yet all
                of these people have embarked on a literally miraculous journey,
                and one that the I invite you to start as well.
