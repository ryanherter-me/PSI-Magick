                This manual is very unique. The world that people live in
                is more spectacular than they ever believed possible, you 
                will be taught how to interact with reality in ways like never before.
              </p>

              <p>
                This book is about tangible, physical, and magickal abilities.
                There are many, many books written on the subject of developing
                psychic abilities, and the vast majority of them are written
                only within the context of the psychic's senses and perceptions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Out of the few that touch on the tangible psychic skills, most
                only offer descriptions of what the abilities are. Very few
                offer any techniques that have real worth for developing the
                more dramatic skills.
              </p>

              <p>
                The goal is to teach the techniques to build the psychic
                *muscles* that makes real, overt, tangible changes, the
                environment and even the relationships between them.
              </p>

              <p>
                You are learning some powerful techniques while developing your
                psychic senses. To be able to produce physical phenomena,
                developing a method of perceiving what's going on at a
                more subtle psychic level is necessary.
              </p>

              <p>
                The good news is that the foundation methods and exercises that
                you are learning here is developing psychic perceptions and
                psychic “muscles” at the same time.
              </p>

              <p>
                With diligent application of the training found within these
                pages, anyone with an open mind and in good health has the
                potential to manifest extraordinary abilities of some sort.
              </p>

              <p>
                Some people might already be experiencing spontaneous events,
                and within a few weeks of practice can start to bring them
                under conscious control.
              </p>

              <p>
                Slowly and subtly, mysterious things start happening
                with increasing reacurrance. Things like traffic lights changing
                in their favor, or wild animals getting surprisingly close to
                them calmly.
              </p>

             
              <p>
                The experiences in this book will act as your 
                guide to avoid suffering the same mistakes
                and setbacks that this book reveals.
              </p>

              <p>
                By reading this manual all the way through before doing any of
                the exercises, people are far more likely to be relaxed,
                prepared, and confident as the first magickal experiance.
              </p>

              <p>
                People can stack the deck in their favor practicing
                lots of different kinds of abilities. While in
                theory, everyone is able to accomplish all abilities, the
                reality is that some people might have more psychological
                barriers to destroy before performing one kind of ability than for
                another.
              </p>

              <p>
                All of the abilities listed on these pages, and many, many more
                are within the reach of the dedicated practitioner. Usually,
                once someone gets their first success in any skill, other skills
                are easier to learn since they already know that all of the
                mental facilities are working together correctly, and they
                realize that the skills are truly possible.
              </p>

              <p>
                Still, people are only human… a persons own personal dedication
                and disposition will dictate how far and how fast a person make
                progress.
