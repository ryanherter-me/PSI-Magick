                There is great excitement to begin, as you take the time to read
                this entire manual from beginning to end, and then
                practicing the exercises
              </p>

              <p>
                It's very important to understanding that things need to work
                together creating a vital component so you can gaining conscious 
                control over all the abilities.
              </p>
<!-- All what abilities?
 



-->
              <p>
                Developing the abilities to perform PSI Magick is richly rewarding, 
                giving all your dedication, practice and patience is key.
              </p>
<!-- What abilities must I develop?



-->
              <p>
                The exercises themselves maybe challenging,
                and rest assured they get consistently easier with
                practice. Many of them can be done anywhere and at
                any time. 
              </p>
<!-- What exercises are you talking about?
 


-->
              <p>
                This course is simply a recipe for PSI Magick. It’s also an
                introduction to parts of your own psyche.
              </p>

                In order to perform PSI Magick, you are going to embark on a
                journey deep within yourself going to places you never even drempt about
                and then with great persistance mastering many of the PSI Magickal 
                ability.

                Most people go about their lives applying mere shards of their
                potential to the situations they face, and as a result they need
                to work hard to overcome those situations. As they say use the 
                right tools for the job.
              </p>

              <p>
                Imagine splitting a log with an axe that has no handle.
                Sure, with enough time and energy it can be done, it may take forever 
                and may be super hard to do. There is a better way.
              </p>

              <p>
                As you integrate more of your facilities, it’s like adding a
                handle to the axe. Then learning the proper grip. Then the
                proper stance. Then the proper distance to the log, and finally
                the proper swing.
              </p>

              <p>
                When all of the pieces come together on the same problem at the
                same time, it can be accomplish in one 
                swing instead of a week’s worth of hacking.
              </p>

              <p>
                In the psychic context, as in so many others, the whole is
                greater than the sum of the parts. This is called synergy.
              </p>

              <p>
                When all aspects of yourself are working harmoniously
                towards the same goal, amazing things become possible, and even
                commonplace.
              </p>

              <p>
                This single skill, this “focus” alone is sufficient to change
                every facet of a persons life for the better. It will allow a
                person to accomplish things that are impossible to
                those who lack understanding of this fundamental principle.
              </p>
<!--What is that fundamental principle?
  Using many/all of your faculties / 
  using right tools for the job. 
  Using the whole package.
What faculties do you have?
  full body orgasm on demand
  change moods rapidly
  visualize

  build many things in the spiritual world
  self hypnosis
  impersonate people/things/objects
Faculty Definition
  an inherent mental or physical power
  an aptitude or talent for doing something
  Any aptitude or ability — inborn or learned — that you have is a faculty

 -->
              <p>
                Since focus is so crucial to our success, realize that the
                informational parts of this book are designed to help people's
                conscious mind understand the “big picture”. People's doubts will
                sabotage their efforts later on.
              </p>

              <p>
                Later in this book you'll learn how the conscious, uncnscious, 
                and collective conscious facets of the mind make up the total 
                mental landscape… and how to get them all to work together in 
                harmony so that you will be able to succeed at the really neat 
                stuff!
              </p>
<!-- this book contains all of the factors to succeed -->
              <p>
                While many other books on psychic development may give some
                exercises that might have some merit in the development of some
                specific psychic skills, very few of them address all of the
                factors that are needed for overall success.
              </p>

              <p>
                Knowing what to do and knowing how to do it are very different
                things, and exercises designed to manifest one specific ability
                may actually harm the true psychic mastery.
              </p>

              
              <p>
                When doing psychic exercises:
              </p>
              <p>Do the exercises correctly</p>
              <p>Do all the exercises equally</p>
              <p>Do them regularly</p>
              <p>Do them moderately.</p>

              <p>
                Doing a little exercise every day will have much better effects
                in the long run than doing a power workout once a week.
