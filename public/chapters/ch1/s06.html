          <p>
                For the reasons the author just listed, it should be obvious
                that a person should be very careful about displaying any
                special abilities to people that a person can't trust completely.
                Some people get away with performing miracles in public under
                the guise of performing “magic tricks”.
              </p>

              <p>
                Regardless of what means a person uses to protect himself, be
                careful to cover a persons tracks. Also, be aware that
                performing a manifestation on a persons own, in a quiet, safe,
                comfortable, familiar environment is completely different then
                attempting the same act in front of an audience… even if that
                audience is just a friend or family member.
              </p>

              <p>
                Understand that it is human nature to fear what is unknown. 
                It is very possible that people you show, even
                people you considered close friends could become fearful of
                you. Be careful not to make people uncomfortable or you
                could even lose friendships. People like the status quo. That’s
                why the herd mentality is so common and so hard to break away
                from for some people.
              </p>

              <p>
                If a person absolutely must demonstrate an ability to someone,
                use the most trivial and unassuming example as that a person can
                think of. For example changing the way the needle on a compass
                points without touching it is a relatively undramatic
                demonstration, and is less likely to promote a fearful response
                from a persons audience than, say, levitating the whole compass,
                or teleporting it across the room.
              </p>

              <p>
                Step lightly! These are traps that could get a person labeled as
                a “Flake”, a “Freak”, or if a person are careless enough, could
                even end up with a person being brought in to a hospital for
                observation.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is better to be cautious and wise than to be reckless. For a
                friend that is about to be sick, a person could always say
                something like “I’ve been feeling a little under the weather
                lately, how are a person feeling?” Or, play off of something
                less mysterious, like “a person look tired. Are a person feeling
                ok?”
              </p>

              <p>In short: Avoid flaunting a persons abilities!</p>

              <p>
                Some final words of caution: Many of the training exercises
                listed in this book can and will alter a persons normal state of
                consciousness. They should never be done immediately before
                swimming, driving, operating heavy machinery or anything where a
                lapse of attention could be harmful to a personsself or others.
              </p>

              <p>
                This brings me to the fact that the author am not a Doctor and
                am not qualified to speculate on any potential dangers involved
                in doing any of these exercises.
              </p>

              <p>
                The reader assumes all risks associated with these exercises.
              </p>

              <p>
                Only a person can be responsible for a persons own well being.
                If a person are performing an exercise from this book and
                something feels wrong, then STOP.
              </p>

              <p>
                Please, please, please, use common sense while doing these
                exercises and when using your amazing abilities.
              </p>

              <p>
               When you are still interested in learning how to
                manifest some tangible psychic skills, then keep reading… a
                person are in for a heck of a ride!
